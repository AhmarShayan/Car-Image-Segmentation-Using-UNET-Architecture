# U-Net for Car Segmentation

This project implements the U-Net architecture based on the paper  
"U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" (Ronneberger et al., 2015).  
The model is applied to the Carvana Image Masking Challenge dataset to perform pixel-wise car segmentation.

## Features

- Encoderâ€“decoder CNN with skip connections for preserving spatial information
- Trained using binary cross-entropy loss
- Data augmentation for improved generalization

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the Carvana Image Masking Challenge.  
You can download it from Kaggle:
